# Handwritten digit recognition

C++ implementation of several machine learnings algorithms
to solve handwritten digit recognition.

No extern library is used, all algorithms are built from scratch


## Build

````bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ ./app
````

## Testing

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build/
$ cmake ..
$ make check
````

## Datasets

The mnist database is used

./data/mnist_train.data containts 50.0000 examples

./data/mnist_test.data contains 10.000 examples

## Algorithms

- Neural Network
